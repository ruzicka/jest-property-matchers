# jest-property-matchers

Easily create property matchers for use with jest's snapshots.

If you are using jest's [snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) for testing, you'll most likely run into problwm that
not all data you are comparing with snapshots could be generated in a deterministic way (so
that they stay always the same). Typically it's autogenerated ids or dates. Jest addresses
this with [property matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing#property-matchers)
but sometimes it can be quite tedious to write.

`jest-property-matchers` package can help you with constructing matcher. Especially in cases
where the matchers are not really consised or if there are too many properties to match.

Typescript declarations are included.
